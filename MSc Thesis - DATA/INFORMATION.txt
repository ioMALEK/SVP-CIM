TO CHECK THE FIGURES: 

1. (Create and) Activate a Python Environment, with Seaborn, Matplotlib, Numpy, Pathlib.
 
2. In each Fig. Folder, there is the DATA folder with the figure(s) data. The PLOTS are the plots you should obtain (the one in the thesis). ASSESSOR_PLOTS is where the plots you generate will appear. Make sure to open your terminal at this folder, and that the pyenv is activated. 

3. Most importantly, there should be a script - this is the plotting script. Execute it, e.g. "python plot_annealed_dual.py", in the terminal, in the correct folder e.g. on my computer "cd cd '/Users/ange/Desktop/SVP_CIM_CPM/MSc Thesis - DATA/CPM Optimisation Sec 3.2/3rd Figure' " - that is the folder where the plotting script is. 

3.Plots should appear in the folder "ASSESSOR_PLOTS" next to DATA, PLOTS and and the script. 

SUMMARY : 

- 1. Pyenv environment with plotting packages.
- 2. Execute the script with the terminal located at the script's folder.
- 3. You may check ASSESSOR_PLOTS and compare it to PLOTS.
